                <p class="text-left">Last updated: February 12, 2018</p>
                <h5>Agencyteam Privacy Policy</h5>
                <p class="text-left">This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information

                    use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website. </p>

                <h5>How do we protect your information?</h5>
                <p class="text-left">We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards. We only provide articles and information. We never ask for credit card numbers. We use regular Malware Scanning. Your personal information is contained behind secured
                    networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive information you supply is encrypted via
                    Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information. All transactions are processed through
                    a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers. </p>
                <h5>Do we use 'cookies'?</h5>
                <p class="text-left">We do not use cookies for tracking purposes. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since each browser is a
                    little different, look at your browser's Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, Some of the features that make your site experience more efficient may not function properly. </p>
                <h5>Third-part disclosure</h5>
                <p class="text-left">We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating
                    our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site
                    policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or safety.&nbsp;However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. </p>
                <h5>Third-party links</h5>
                <p class="text-left">Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the
                    content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites. </p>
                <h5>Google </h5>
                <p class="text-left">Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en.</p>
                <p class="text-left">We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website. Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to our site and other
                    sites on the Internet. Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network privacy policy. </p>
                <h5>We have implemented the following:</h5>
                <ul style="color:#7d8285;">
                    <li>Demographics and Interests Reporting </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-left">We, along with third-party vendors such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding
                    user interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to our website. </p>
                <h5>Opting out:</h5>

                    on. </p>
                <h5>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h5>
                <p class="text-left">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably
                    the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or
                    companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf </p>
                <h5>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h5>
                <p class="text-left">Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy'
                    and can easily be found on the page specified above. </p>
                <p class="text-left">You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes: </p>
                <ul style="color:#7d8285;">
                    <li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-left">Can change your personal information: </p>
                <ul style="color:#7d8285;">
                    <li>By emailing us</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h5>
                <p class="text-left">We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. </p>
                <h5>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h5>
                <p class="text-left">It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking. </p>
                <h5>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h5>
                <p class="text-left">When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection
                    agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old. </p>
                <h5>Fair Information Practices</h5>
                <p class="text-left">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the
                    Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information. </p>
                <h5>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practives we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</h5>
                <p class="text-left">We will notify you via email</p>
                <ul style="color:#7d8285;">
                    <li>Within 1 business day</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-left">We will notify the users via in-site notification</p>
                <ul style="color:#7d8285;">
                    <li>Within 1 business day</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>CAN SPAM Act</h5>
                <p class="text-left">The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
                    </p>
                <h5>We collect your email address in order to:</h5>
                <ul style="color:#7d8285;">

                </ul>
                <h5>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</h5>
                <ul style="color:#7d8285;">

                <h5>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can:</h5>
                <ul style="color:#7d8285;">
                    <li style="color:#7d8285;">Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email. </li>
